## 1. Rasterizer

In this assignment, I implemented a simple rasterizer in Python. The rasterizer processes 2D images by converting geometric descriptions of shapes into pixel data, simulating the basic steps of rendering.

## 2. Rotation Interpolation and Modern GL Shading

This assignment focused on implementing various rotation interpolation methods, including **Euler angles** and **quaternions**. I also used Modern GL shaders to implement **Blinn-Phong shading**, which enhances the scene with realistic light reflections. Additionally, the system includes two eyepoint perspectives, enabled by appropriate coordinate-space transformations.

## 3. Mesh Subdivision

In this assignment, I implemented a **mesh subdivision algorithm** using a **half-edge data structure (HEDS)**. The algorithm refines the mesh by subdividing its faces, and the interface allows visual exploration of mesh faces, vertices, and half-edges. Users can navigate between different subdivision levels, viewing the **odd and even vertices** used in the algorithm and the normals for each face.

### Subdivision Levels
